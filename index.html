        <p>Hey there!</p>
        <br>

          <p>This is Sadaf.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
          If I had to put together a group of words to describe myself, they would be, a History enthusiast Computer Science grad who also happens to be a writer and an avid Arsenal FC fan. I hail from the hustling and bustling city of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. I have lived through 24 springs in my life, so far. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>  
        Even though computer science is my first love, I didn’t limit myself to that field in order to make myself more versatile. Which allowed me to live the lives of a marketeer, a teacher and a writer as mentioned above. 
      </p> 
      <br>
      <p>Other than that I like to travel to places near the sea. My music taste includes Bengali classical music, hip-hop and EDM. And yes! I go on hours reading anything about history.</p>
      <br>   
      <p>
          In this blog, I will offer you a portal to enter my mind!

                  The day I received my final grade from BRAC University, I got a phone call saying I have been selected for the Xcelerate Internship program of British American Tobacco Bangladesh. I was asked whether I was willing to go outside Dhaka to work with their trade marketing team. I agreed without any hesitation, as the trade marketing team of BATB was very well reputed. They are one of the best in the country. My posting was at a town called Tangail on the outskirts of Dhaka. I am forever grateful to my team, over there, for giving me a new perspective towards professionalism, confidence, and teamwork. In those three months away from home, not only did I learn the basics of trade marketing while working with a root level audience but also adaptability in a place with no known faces around.

I have uncles and aunts who are actively involved in the literary scene of our country. Even my own mother is a professor of Bangla literature. Therefore, since childhood, I nurtured a passion for writing and to give fruition to that passion I joined New Age in 2014. New Age is one of the biggest English newspaper in Bangladesh. Here, I basically worked on the Culture and Youth sections. Through New Age, I met several inspiring people, with stories to tell and I felt honored to portray their stories for the world.

                  I completed my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science form BRAC University in September 2018. I tried not to leave any page unturned during my time there. Starting from being an active member of co-curricular clubs to maintaing good enough grades each semester, this institution pushed me out of my limits of comfort. However, I was fortunate to have come across some amazing faculty members and valuable friends who not only assisted me to finish the journey but also brought the best out of me.

I was fortunate enough to not only receive a top-notch education from amazing teachers but also formed friendships that are standing strong for more than a decade. I was also actively involved in the cultural scene and community service club.
